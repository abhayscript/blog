    <h1>Diwali & future plans </h1>
    <p>Date: 31 Oct 2024</p>
    <p> Reached home by 10:00am, in afternoon there was little pain in my stomach afterwards having some pills everything got in control um.  So it was Diwali everything was good and cool. Thinking how to plan my coding journey honestly I don't have to find which route to follow, I want to do everything from machine learning to IoT to hardware  all even thinking to mix biomedical to engineering  things too. I just to learn everything and build cool things.
But there should be a route, I am thinking my first priority should be learn something and have some intership /job opportunities. Later on life I can learn everything and build things, sound quite promising. Ok so tomorrow, 1 November I will make plan, a actionable plan.
