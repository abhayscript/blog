    <h1>Diwali & Future Plans</h1>
    <p>Date: 31 Oct 2024</p>
    <p>
        Reached home by 10:00 am. In the afternoon, there was some stomach pain, but after taking some pills, it got under control.
        It was Diwali; everything was good and cool. I am reflecting on my coding journey and figuring out the route to take.
        I want to explore everything, from machine learning to IoT and hardware, and even mix in biomedical engineering.
        My first priority should be to gain skills that can lead to internships or job opportunities. Later in life, I can
        pursue everything else. Tomorrow, 1 November, I will make a concrete, actionable plan.
