    <h1>Looking Delhi through window</h1>
    <p>Date: 30 Oct 2024</p>
    <p>So today I am going to leave  Delhi will reach home at 31 October. Yesterday night pretty harsh for me  whole night my  stomach was in pain it  and felt like puking. Since  rituximab Iv is given my stomach  got swelling  or I will say blooming belly  I can related to to pregnant women quite how they might discomfort while sleeping while angling or changing sides  arching or  Stooping  ah painful discomfort.  It been seven days  since stomach have gotten this, whole day I took rest and was sad how yesterday everything seem so fine and  till night, since night everything gotten little worse  I am talking about puking and stomach pain and 5 :00 pm  we left the room for  bus ( apparently all the train were full, even bus  but anyhow we got a   bus)  Uber driver taken extra fares idk how maybe their app don't work properly the fare was ₹320 and app just  shown it  around ₹565.  Later on  done  the complaint part it was hustle free refund, on the bus I just walk here and there and seeping of my stomach got better idk how there is sweeling or tight blooming got loose it felt good  thank god. Reached to bus  and took the seat and driver and I was just  thinking why most people don't travel with bus off season as bus fare will have  low fare and better  seat than train and   bus  conductor accounced everyone should go kashmere Gate no:13  here  they have  casualties t to do. Again I walked around to that specific gate. Felt good while walking  , I shouid consider now walking more, when I will reach home  I will walk 2 hours daily.  So all passengers just left their seat and just kept walking in  line like a assembly um. We reached to gate most people just disperse or just started fan out.  I was relax and  quite chill standing, a girl  asked me she as from my bus  (I  know this because she was from the queue  I was part of) she asked me in  weepy voice  is bus going to arrive here  or not   she was in so painic and  just about to cry, I just said yes.   why people distress about little things  maybe she was girl all alone and most family  aren't supportive maybe, Idk . Then second girl came same question she was not weeping tho, then a guy came these were  going through different bus) why  people  are asking to me is I seem knowledgeable (  I or lookalike  conductor) here  approachable  idk why Ah last we just got on bus and going home . 
Looking  Delhi through window  while lying down  will reach home at 10 am .
